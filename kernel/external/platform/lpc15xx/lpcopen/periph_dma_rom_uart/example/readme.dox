/** @defgroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX_DMA_ROM_UART LPC15xx UART using DMA ROM example
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * This examples shows how to use the DMA ROM driver to handle servicing
 * of UART transmit and receive operations to offload the MCU and reduce
 * interrupt processing.<br>
 *
 * UART transmit operations have a known transmit size and are queued to the
 * DMA controller via descriptors setup for the transfer. Descriptors are
 * only queued to the DMA controller when data is waiting to be sent.
 * This specific implementation can queue multiple UART buffers with a single
 * DMA interrupt per UART buffer sent. This example doesn't used linked
 * DMA descriptors.<br>
 *
 * UART receive operations have a fixed list of descriptors and buffer sizes
 * setup for a Ping Pong transfer, linked list is not supported by the ROM driver.
 * The DMA controller will generate a DMA interrupt for UART receive only when
 * a full buffer of data has been received. Once this buffer is received, it
 * is sent back out via UART transmit via DMA.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
