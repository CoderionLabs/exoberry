/** @defgroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX_SYSTICK LPC15xx Simple systick example
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * The Systick example simply blinks an LED at a periodic rate using the systick
 * timer and SYSTICK clock divider. The LED state is toggled in the systick
 * interrupt handler.<br>
 *
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * While one would expect a clock divider to delay an interrupt occurrence this implementation
 * seems to hasten the interrupt occurrence. For example, if the SYSTICK clock divider is set
 * to 1, 453 interrupts occur in a 30-second interval.  If the SYSTICK clock divider is set 
 * to 2, one would expect to see half the interrupt count however twice the interrupts occure as
 * though the clock divider were really a clock multiplier.<br>
 *
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * In addition, once the SYSTICK clock divider is set and SYSTICK is enabled, the SYSTICK clock 
 * divider becomes static, changes seem to have no effect.  Once the clock was running, the effective 
 * rate could not be changed or the SYSTICK timer clock disabled as described in the UM.
 * 
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
