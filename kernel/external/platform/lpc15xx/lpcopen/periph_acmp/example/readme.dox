/** @defgroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX_ACMP LPC15xx Analog Comparator example
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * The ACMP example demonstrates using the analog comparator.<br>
 *
 * This example configures the positive voltage input as the voltage
 * found on ADC1_1/PIN0.9, which is trimmed through the potentiometer.
 * The negative voltage input is obtained from the voltage ladder, the
 * voltage ladder output is set to around 50% of Vdd.
 * Adjust the POT up and down to adjust the voltage into the analog
 * comparator. When the voltage crosses the negative voltage input,
 * a CMP IRQ is fired. Based on which side of the voltage is in
 * reference to the bandgap, the LED state will change.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
