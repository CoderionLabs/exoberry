/** @defgroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX_SPISLAVEPOLL LPC15xx SPI bus slave (polling) example using the ROM API
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * This example shows how to configure SPI as a bus slave in polling mode using
 * the ROM-based APIs.<br>
 *
 * This example configures SPI as a slave to read an array of 4 words of 16 bits using polling mode.
 * The received data is output through the Debug UART port.
 * To test the example a SPI master needs to be connected, the SPI master needs to keep transmitting
 * the 4 words which will be outputted on the UART port of the slave. Since the slave transmits the received
 * SPI data on UART, the master should allow sufficient (around 10ms) delay between each transfer. <br>
 *
* <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * A SPI master should be connected to test this example the SPI connections are as below: <br>
 * SCK - P0.0 - J2 pin7 on Expresso board <br>
 * MOSI - P0.16 - J2 pin5 on Expresso board <br>
 * MISO - P0.10 - J2 pin4 on Expresso board <br>
 * SSEL0 - P0.9 - J2 pin3 on Expresso board <br>
