 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * The LPC15xx ADC ROM example shows how to use the ADC ROM API to perform
 * a sequence of conversions and monitor a threshold crossing.<br>
 *
 * ADC0 is configured to monitor the internal temperature sensor on
 * ADC0 channel 0. It is setup to be triggered periodically by the
 * sysTick interrupt.<br>
 *
 * ADC1 is configured to monitor an analog input signal on ADC1. The
 * ADC channel used may vary per board. It is setup to be triggered
 * periodically by the sysTick interrupt with optional threshold
 * support.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * To use this example, ADC1 channel 1 needs to be connected to an
 * analog source.<br>
