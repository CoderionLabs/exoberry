 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * The example shows how to us USBD ROM stack to creates a HID keyboard.
 * <br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * The tiny joystick that is surface mounted on the eval board has 4 positions
 * and a button press. They act as number keys '2', '4', '6', '8', and NUMLOCK.
 * The joystick press toggles NUMLOCK. When NUMLOCK is ON the joystick positions
 * are mapped to the arrow keys. For most OSs, no drivers are needed.<br>
