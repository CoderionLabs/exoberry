 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * The Grouped GPIO interrupt example demonstrates the Grouped GPIO interrupt feature.<br>
 *
 * This example configures Grouped GPIO interrupt 0 to be invoked when a button is 
 * pressed by the user. The interrupt toggles the state of an LED. 
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
