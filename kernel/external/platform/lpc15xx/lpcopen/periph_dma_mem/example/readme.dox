/** @defgroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX_DMA_MEM LPC15xx DMA memory to memory transfer example
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * This example shows how to setup and use the DMA controller for a limited
 * software triggered memory to memory transfer. Because of the limited burst
 * transfer size of the DMA (1024 transfers max) and limited burst size, DMA
 * M2M operations are somewhat specialized, but they do have a good performance
 * boost over memcpy() and memmove() functions. They would work best for
 * smaller transfers.<br>
 *
 * Time measurement for performance is in milliSeconds. Lower values indicate
 * higher data transfer performance. A time 50% smaller than another time would
 * mean the same operation was about 2x faster. Times are provided for similar
 * memmove(), memcpy(), and DMA data move operations.<br>
 *
 * The example also includes a test enable definition (XFERTEST) that will
 * also perform data testing when it is defined.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
