/**
 * A generic pool allocator.
 *
 * This is an efficient (constant-time allocation and freeing) allocator for objects of a fixed size
 * and alignment (typically, fixed type), based on a fixed-size object pool.
 *
 * The main API works with void* buffers and a couple of helper macros are used for a type-safe
 * (well, as far as C can go with type safety) "templatization" of the pool for a specific object
 * type.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *
 * typedef struct {
 *   ...
 * } foo_t;
 *
 * // "Specialize" the pool for type foo_t.
 * #define FOO_POOL_STORAGE_SIZE(object_count) TYPED_POOL_STORAGE_SIZE(foo_t, object_count)
 * #define FOO_POOL_STORAGE_ALIGN() TYPED_POOL_STORAGE_ALIGN(foo_t)
 * #define DEFINE_FOO_POOL_STORAGE(name, count) DEFINE_TYPED_POOL_STORAGE(foo_t, name, count)
 * #define FOO_POOL_INIT(pool, count, storage) TYPED_POOL_INIT(foo_t, pool, count, storage)
 * #define FOO_POOL_ALLOC(pool) TYPED_POOL_ALLOC(foo_t, pool)
 * #define FOO_POOL_FREE(pool, object) TYPED_POOL_FREE(foo_t, pool, object)
 *
 * // Allocate storage for a pool of 100 objects.
 * DEFINE_FOO_POOL_STORAGE(foo_pool_storage, 100);
 *
 * // Alternatively, allocate storage some other way, using the FOO_POOL_STORAGE_SIZE() and
 * // FOO_POOL_STORAGE_ALIGN() to determine the required size and alignment of the storage buffer.
 *
 * // Instantiate the pool.
 * pool_t pool;
 * FOO_POOL_INIT(&pool, 100, &foo_pool_storage);
 *
 * // Allocate a foo_t from the pool.
 * foo_t * newfoo =  FOO_POOL_ALLOC(&pool);
 *
 * if (!newfoo) {
 *   // Handle allocation failure.
 * } else {
 *   // Use newfoo.
 *   ...
 *   // Free it.
 *   FOO_POOL_FREE(&pool, newfoo);
 * }
