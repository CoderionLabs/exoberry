/** @defgroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX_UART0_ROM_API_POLLING LPC15xx UART polling example using ROM API
 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * The UART example shows how to use the UART ROM API in polled mode.
 * This example only applies to USART0.<br>
 *
 * To use the example, connect a serial cable to the board's RS232/UART port and
 * start a terminal program to monitor the port.  The terminal program on the host
 * PC should be setup for 115200-8-N-1.
 * Once the example is started, a small message is printed on terminal. Any data
 * received will be returned back to the caller.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * The LPCXpresso base board is required with the LPCXpresso board to use this
 * example. The Manley board needs no extra hardware.<br>
 *
