 * @ingroup EXAMPLES_PERIPH_15XX
 * <b>Example description</b><br>
 * The DAC example demonstrates using the Digital to Analog Converter.<br>
 *
 * This example uses the DAC to produce a stepped saw tooth waveform at 100Hz.
 * It uses the internal timer as a trigger source for generating DAC interrupts
 * The timer is set up to generate interrupts at 2KHz i.e. 20 DAC output samples
 * for every sawtooth waveform. At the occurrence of the DAC interrupt the DAC input
 * register is updated with an incremented value and the value is reset after it
 * crosses the 12bit boundary for DAC input. P0.12 is the set up as the DAC output
 * By connecting an oscilloscope to P0.12 and ground you will notice a stepped sawtooth 
 * waveform at 100Hz.<br>
 *
 * <b>Special connection requirements</b><br>
 * There are no special connection requirements for this example.<br>
